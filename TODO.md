# The Board
The board has a few locations:

- Play space
- Discard pile
- Library
- Teammates hands
- Player's hand.
- Hint/Burn zone

### Playspace
The area where played cards live.

### Discard pile
Where discarded cards go; important in that players must be able to access the cards to see what has already been played. In the paper version of the game there are no rules around the organization of this space.

### Library
Players must be able to see the number of remaining cards.

### Other Players' Hands
The order of the cards in the hand must remain the same as in the player's hand.

### Hands

Player usually should be able to rearrange the order of their cards through dragging. Also, they need to be able to reorient their cards so that they may store information that way. They also need to be able to separate them somewhat so that they can keep them oriented.

### Hint / Burn zone

Stores the number of hints and burns there are. Most games start with 8 hints and 3 burns. If you burn out you lose the game with 0 points.


### Pass and Play?

## Tasks

- Setup Resty end points to pass data between various clients, so we can start games.
